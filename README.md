# UIKit Apprentice
This repo contains the projects associated with **UIKit Apprentice - 2nd Edition** book by [Kodeco](https://www.kodeco.com/books/uikit-apprentice).

I applied the basic principles of iOS app development:
- Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- Storyboards (Scenes, Segues, Controls, Views)
- Auto Layout (Constraints, Removing ambiguities)
- Navigation (UINavigationController, UITabBarController)
- Table View
- Collection View
- Encoding/Decoding Data
- User Defaults
- Core Data
- Swift Basics to Intermediate
- Core Location
- Persisting Data with Property Lists
